### Version 3: Optimized GPU Implementation

This directory contains the optimized GPU implementation of the MNIST classification algorithm.

## Overview

The optimized GPU implementation builds upon the naive GPU version by incorporating several key optimizations to maximize GPU utilization and performance. This version focuses on four main optimization areas:



## Running the Implementation

To run the optimized GPU implementation, simply use the provided makefile:

```shellscript
# Compile the code
make

# Run the program
make run
```

This will compile and execute the optimized GPU version of the algorithm, processing the MNIST dataset that you've downloaded and placed in the data directory.

## Expected Output

After running the implementation, you'll see performance metrics including:

- GPU device information (name, compute capability, number of SMs)
- Training time per epoch
- Total training time
- Testing accuracy
- A profiling report (profile_results.txt) generated by nvprof
